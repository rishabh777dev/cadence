/**
 * Hands dictation results to the iOS keyboard extension.
 *
 * The keyboard can't use the microphone (iOS blocks mic capture in keyboard
 * extensions), so its mic button opens this app to capture + transcribe. When a
 * dictation finishes, the app writes the final transcript into the shared App
 * Group container; the keyboard reads it (via `SharedStore.swift`) when it
 * reappears and inserts it into the host field.
 *
 * No-op on Android (the keyboard is iOS-only) and when the native module is
 * unavailable (e.g. running in Expo Go).
