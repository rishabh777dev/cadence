/**
 * Cleanup-prompt configuration: the *content* of the cleanup prompts (intensity
 * preset bodies, destination tone blocks, language constraints, and app/site
 * routing tables), plus a fetcher that overrides the bundled copy with the
 * latest config served by Freestyle Cloud.
 *
 * The strings below are the offline fallback. On startup (and every ~6 hours)
 * `refreshCleanupPromptConfig()` fetches `GET /v2/prompts/cleanup?v=<appVersion>`
 * and swaps in the cloud copy so prompt improvements reach users without an app
 * release. The resolution order for every read is:
 *
 *   fresh cloud (< 6h) -> stale cloud (fetch failed) -> bundled fallback
 *
 * Nothing is ever lost: the TTL only decides when we *try* to refresh. If the
 * refresh fails (offline), the last-fetched copy is kept; if we never fetched,
 * the bundled copy below is used. Prompt *assembly* stays local (see
 * `prompts.ts`/`rewrite-context.ts`) — this module only holds data + the fetch.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: keep the bundled strings below in sync with the cloud repo's
 * `apps/server/src/routes/v2/prompt-config.ts` (the single source of truth).
 * Drift only affects how quickly an improvement reaches offline users, never
 * correctness — but a synced copy keeps offline behavior identical to online.

Layout rules:
- Put the spoken greeting on its own line, followed by a blank line. This applies even to short greetings like "hi", "hey", "hello", "good morning". The greeting MUST be on its own line — never leave it inlined with the body as "Hi, body text on the same line" or "Good morning, body text on the same line". Put the spoken name in the greeting when it was dictated (for example "hey alex" becomes "Hey Alex," on its own line).
- Break the body into one to three short paragraphs separated by blank lines. Each paragraph should be roughly one to three sentences. Do not keep the whole body as a single dense line that runs from the greeting into the sign-off.
- Put a spoken sign-off on its own line. If the speaker also said a sender name (for example "thanks, sean"), put the name on the next line below the sign-off.
- Use a blank line between the greeting, the body paragraphs, and the sign-off so the result reads like a real email draft and not a single paragraph.
- If the transcript has a spoken greeting but no spoken sign-off, still apply the greeting-on-its-own-line and paragraph layout. Do not invent a sign-off that the speaker did not say.
- Never invent a subject line, never invent a greeting or sign-off, and never add a paragraph or list the speaker did not imply.
- If the transcript does not look like an email at all (no greeting, no sign-off, no email-style phrasing, and no clear body), keep it as cleaned prose and do not add email layout.

Texture example, do not copy verbatim: "hi alex can you send me the latest version of the deck when you get a chance thanks" should become "Hi Alex,\n\nCan you send me the latest version of the deck when you get a chance?\n\nThanks,".`,
