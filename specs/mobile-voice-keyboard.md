# Freestyle Voice Keyboard (iOS keyboard extension)

Status: in progress — **rearchitected: app-side capture** (keyboard delegates
dictation to the app; awaits on-device validation)
Owner: mobile
Related: `mobile-cloud-voice-typing.md`, cloud `apps/server/src/routes/v2/*`

## ⚠️ Architecture change (supersedes §3–§7 in-keyboard capture)

**iOS keyboard extensions cannot access the microphone**, even with "Allow Full
Access" (Full Access only grants network + the shared App Group container).
Confirmed on-device: `AVAudioEngine.start()` fails with
`kAudioUnitErr_CannotDoInCurrentContext` (`'what'`, 2003329396); the audio HAL
refuses to start the input unit in the keyboard's process. The backup branch hit
the same wall — it added an `AVAudioRecorder` keyboard, then stripped
mic/recording out (`dab109c`) and replaced the keyboard with a Share Extension
(`8d47a55`). This is an Apple sandbox rule, not a config bug.

**New design — delegate capture to the containing app:**
1. Keyboard mic tap → `openURL("freestyle://dictate")` launches the app (Full
   Access required for `openURL` + App Group).
2. The app's `dictate` screen auto-records, streams to `/v2/stream` (this works
   fine in the app), and on the final transcript writes it to the App Group via
   the `freestyle-shared-store` module (`setPendingTranscript`, timestamped).
3. The user returns to the host app; the keyboard's `viewWillAppear` reads the
   fresh transcript (`SharedStore.swift`) and `insertText`s it into the field.

Trade-off: an app-switch round trip (unavoidable given the sandbox). This is the
standard, App-Store-approved pattern for voice keyboards.

Progress:
- [x] **Phase 1** — `plugins/withKeyboardExtension.js` adds the
  `FreestyleKeyboard` app-extension target (App Group, Full-Access request,
  embed).
- [x] **Capture rearchitected to app-side** (see the box above). Keyboard
  (`KeyboardViewController.swift`): neutral minimal panel (mic + globe + delete +
  space + return); mic opens `freestyle://dictate`; `viewWillAppear` inserts the
  App Group transcript via `SharedStore.swift`.
- [x] **App dictation screen** `src/app/(app)/dictate.tsx` — auto-records +
  streams to `/v2/stream`, writes the final to the App Group
  (`setPendingTranscript`), prompts the user to return.
- [x] **App Group bridge** — local Expo module `freestyle-shared-store`
  (`setPendingTranscript` / `clear`) + `src/lib/keyboard-bridge.ts`.
- [x] In-app setup screen `src/app/(app)/keyboard-setup.tsx` +
  `freestyle://keyboard-setup` deep link and a Settings entry point.

### Superseded work (removed)

The in-keyboard streaming stack from the earlier plan was removed once the
sandbox limit was confirmed: `AudioEngineCapture.swift`, `WaveformView.swift`,
`CloudStreamSession.swift`, `CloudTranscriber.swift` (keyboard copies), and the
keyboard's session-token/prefs sync. The app already owns the streaming client
(`src/lib/cloud/stream.ts`), so the keyboard needs none of it.

## Decisions (locked)

- **Backend**: real-time **streaming** (`WSS /v2/stream`) with a **batch
  fallback** (`POST /v2/transcribe`) when the socket can't open. (§4)
- **Partials UX**: v1 shows live partials in the keyboard's **status strip**;
  only the committed **final** is inserted into the host field. In-field
  partials (delete/insert diffing) are a later upgrade. (§7)
- **Layout**: **minimal** — mic + globe + space + delete + return. No QWERTY in
  v1; users switch to the system keyboard for manual typing. (§1)
- **Platform**: **iOS only** for v1. Android (`InputMethodService`) is a
  separate follow-up. (§10)
- **Auth**: better-auth **bearer session token** shared via a keychain access
  group; non-secret prefs via the App Group. (§5)

## 1. Goal

A **system-wide iOS keyboard** with a mic button so users can dictate into
**any** app's text field (Messages, Mail, Notes, Safari…) — the Soniox "type
anywhere with your voice" experience. Transcription goes through **Freestyle
Cloud v2**, reusing the main app's signed-in session. Text is inserted directly
into the host app's active text field.

Non-goal for v1: a full QWERTY layout. We ship a **minimal** keyboard (mic +
globe/switch + space + delete + return); users switch to the system keyboard
for manual typing. This keeps the extension small and focused.

Platform: **iOS first**. Android (`InputMethodService`) is a follow-up.

## 2. Prior art (backup branch)

`feat/expo-backup` scaffolded a working keyboard (commits `8ff7c70` →
`41eeb47`), then **removed it** (`8d47a55`) in favour of a Share
Extension/Widget/Siri. We reuse its proven structure but change the backend:

- `plugins/withKeyboardExtension.js` — Expo config plugin that adds a
  `FreestyleKeyboard` app-extension target to the Xcode project during
  prebuild, wires App Groups, entitlements, Info.plist, and embeds the
  `.appex`. **Reusable almost as-is.**
- `ios-keyboard/KeyboardViewController.swift` — mic/globe/space/delete/return
  UI, dark-mode aware. **Reusable, retitle + restyle to current design.**
- `ios-keyboard/AudioRecorder.swift` — `AVAudioRecorder` → m4a. **Reused only
  for the batch fallback**; the streaming path adds `AVAudioEngine` capture.
- `ios-keyboard/TranscriptionService.swift` — **replaced**: was BYOK
  (OpenAI/Groq/…); becomes Freestyle Cloud v2 clients — `CloudStreamSession`
  (WS `/v2/stream`) plus a `CloudTranscriber` batch fallback (`/v2/transcribe`).
- `ios-keyboard/SharedConfig.swift` — App Group `UserDefaults` bridge.
  **Repurposed**: instead of API keys, it reads the cloud session + prefs.

## 3. Hard iOS constraints (design drivers)

1. **Memory ceiling ~60–70 MB.** The extension is killed if it exceeds it.
   → We stream (per the decision), so we must be strict: native audio only, no
   whole-recording buffering, a small reusable conversion buffer, and prompt
   teardown of the engine + socket. Batch is the fallback. Profile with
   Instruments before shipping. (See §4 memory discipline.)
2. **"Allow Full Access" required** for mic + network. Without it, the
   extension is sandboxed with no network/mic. We must detect this
   (`hasFullAccess`) and show an inline "Enable Full Access in Settings"
   prompt. This is an explicit, scary-sounding user step — unavoidable for any
   voice keyboard.
3. **Separate process, no Expo/JS runtime.** The extension is **native Swift
   only** — it cannot call our TS cloud client. All cloud logic (WebSocket
   streaming + batch POST) is reimplemented in Swift.
4. **No direct access to the app's JS state.** Config crosses the process
   boundary via an **App Group** (`group.com.freestylevoice.app`).

## 4. Backend: streaming v2 (chosen) with batch fallback

Decision (user): the keyboard uses **real-time streaming** (`WSS /v2/stream`)
so text appears live as you speak, matching the standalone app and Soniox.
Batch (`POST /v2/transcribe`) is kept as a **fallback** when the socket fails
or Full Access/network is flaky.

### Streaming path (native Swift, no `ws`/JS)
- **Audio capture**: `AVAudioEngine` input tap → convert to **PCM16, 16 kHz,
  mono** with `AVAudioConverter` (Soniox's required format). Native conversion
  is far lighter than the RN resampler; feed frames straight to the socket.
- **WebSocket**: `URLSessionWebSocketTask` to `wss://…/v2/stream` with
  `Authorization: Bearer <sessionToken>` header. Mirror the app's protocol
  exactly: send `{type:"start", language, skipPostProcess, intensity}` on open,
  stream binary PCM frames, `{type:"commit", audioDurationMs}` on stop; receive
  `session.ready` / `partial` / `final` / `error`.
- **Live insertion**: render `partial` by diffing against the last inserted
  text — delete the previous partial's characters via `deleteBackward()` and
  `insertText()` the new one, so the host field updates live. On `final`,
  settle the text. (Simpler v1: show partials in the keyboard's own status
  strip and only `insertText` the committed `final` — avoids fighting host-app
  autocorrect. Start here, upgrade to in-field partials if it feels good.)
- Auth is the better-auth **bearer session token** (simplest cross-process —
  no cookie jar). 401 → "open Freestyle to sign in"; 429 → "out of credits".

### Batch fallback
`POST /v2/transcribe` multipart (`AVAudioRecorder` m4a) → insert `cleaned`.
Used when the WS can't open or errors before `session.ready`.

### Memory discipline (critical — see §3)
- Stream frames immediately; **never buffer** the whole recording.
- Use a small fixed-size scratch buffer for conversion; reuse it.
- Tear down `AVAudioEngine` + WS on stop/dismiss; release on `didReceiveMemoryWarning`.
- No JS runtime, no image assets — keep the extension lean. Profile with
  Instruments (Allocations + the ~60–70 MB jetsam limit) before shipping.

## 5. Auth sharing (main app → extension)

The extension needs a credential to call the cloud. Two viable channels:

- **Preferred: keychain access group.** `expo-secure-store` supports
  `accessGroup`. Store a **bearer session token** under a shared access group
  (`$(AppIdentifierPrefix)com.freestylevoice.app.shared`) that both the app
  target and the keyboard target can read. The extension reads it directly from
  the keychain in Swift.
- **Alternative: App Group UserDefaults.** Simpler to wire but less secure for
  a credential (UserDefaults isn't encrypted at rest the way keychain is). Use
  App Group **only** for non-secret prefs (language, cleanup on/off, base URL,
  onboarding/full-access hints).

Decision: **session token in the shared keychain access group; prefs in the App
Group UserDefaults.** The app writes both on sign-in / settings change; a small
native module (or `expo-secure-store` `accessGroup` + a tiny UserDefaults
bridge) performs the writes.

Token lifetime: better-auth session tokens are long-lived but can expire /
be revoked. The extension treats 401 as "not signed in" and shows a prompt to
open the app. The app refreshes the shared token on launch and on
`useSession()` changes.

  target 16.0.

## 7. UX / states (KeyboardViewController)

### Layout — Soniox voice panel (reference: soniox.com/soniox-app/voice-typing)

The keyboard is a **single voice panel**, not a QWERTY grid. It fills the
standard keyboard area and reads text-first:

```
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  (✕)                                     (✓)    │  ← cancel / commit
│                                                 │
│        Pouvez-vous me donner une recette         │  ← live transcription
│              de déjeuner rapide ?                │     (centered, large)
│              · · · · · · · · ·                  │  ← thin waveform (level-driven)
│                  listening…                     │  ← status (muted)
│                                                 │
│            unstyled transcription               │  ← raw/cleaned mode label
│  (⊕)                                            │  ← globe: switch keyboards
└───────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Cancel (✕, top-left)** — discard the utterance, insert nothing, back to
  idle. Light circular button.
- **Commit (✓, top-right)** — stop + finalize; insert the committed text into
  the host field. Dark filled circular button (primary action).
- **Live transcription (center)** — the interim/`partial` text, large and
  centered, updating as you speak. This is the hero of the panel (Soniox shows
  the sentence forming here, not in the host field, until commit).
- **Waveform** — a thin row of level-driven bars just under the text (reuse the
  app's `Waveform` behavior), giving "it's listening" feedback.
- **Status** — muted `listening…` while streaming; `polishing…` while the
  cloud cleans on commit.
- **Mode label** — small centered micro-label at the bottom: `unstyled
  transcription` when cleanup is off, otherwise e.g. `neutral tone` (reflects
  the shared cleanup/tone prefs). Tapping it is a future shortcut to toggle.
- **Globe (⊕, bottom-left)** — `advanceToNextInputMode()` to switch keyboards.
- **Auto-start**: because the whole panel is the voice surface, streaming can
  begin as soon as the keyboard appears (and Full Access is granted), matching
  Soniox's "hold fn"/instant model. v1: start on first appearance or on a
  center tap; ✓ commits, ✕ cancels. (Decide during Phase 2.)

### States

- **No Full Access** → replace the panel body with a short message + a button
  deep-linking to Settings; no mic/network attempted.
- **Idle** (pre-start) → dim placeholder ("Tap to speak") + globe.
- **Streaming** → live text + animated waveform + `listening…`; ✓/✕ active.
- **Finalizing** → `polishing…`; on `final`, `insertText(final)` into the host
  field, then reset.
- **Errors**: 401 → "Open Freestyle to sign in"; 429 → "Out of credits";
  network → transient inline message. Never crash the host app.
- Respect light/dark via `traitCollection`. The reference uses a neutral
  light-grey panel with a dark primary (✓) accent; we map that to Freestyle's
  paper/ink with the olive/red accent on the active waveform + commit button.

### Insertion model (v1)

Show partials **inside the panel** (not the host field) and only
`textDocumentProxy.insertText(final)` on commit. This avoids fighting host-app
autocorrect and matches Soniox's panel-first flow. In-field live partials
(delete/insert diffing) remain a later upgrade (§5 of phasing).

### Visual direction (Soniox-inspired — soniox.com/soniox-app/voice-typing)

The Soniox keyboard reads as calm and single-purpose: a large centered mic
control with a live waveform that reacts to speech, minimal chrome, and text
appearing instantly. We adopt the same restraint within Freestyle's language:

- **Centerpiece mic** — one prominent circular mic button, centered, with a
  soft colored halo/pulse that swells with the live input level (mirrors the
  standalone app's redesigned `MicButton`). Olive when idle, warm red while
  recording.
- **Live waveform strip** — a thin row of level-driven bars above/around the
  mic (mirrors the app's `Waveform`), giving immediate "it's listening"
  feedback. This doubles as the v1 partials location: show interim text in a
  single-line strip beneath the waveform, commit `final` into the host field.
- **Minimal keys** — mic + globe + space + delete + return only; generous
  spacing, no busy QWERTY grid. Rounded, pill-like keys consistent with the
  app's `Radius.full` buttons.
- **Typography** — JetBrains Mono uppercase micro-labels for status
  ("LISTENING", "POLISHING"), matching the app. Keep color usage sparse:
  paper/ink neutrals with the olive/red accent only on the mic + active bars.
- **Motion** — reuse the app's motion vocabulary (breathing halo, flowing
  bars) so the keyboard feels like the same product, not a bolt-on.

Reuse the standalone app's redesigned `MicButton`/`Waveform`/`icons` as the
visual reference when porting to Swift (`AVAudioEngine` level → the same
halo/bar behavior).

## 8. Build & test

- Native-only: requires `expo prebuild` + a **dev client / EAS build**. Does
  **not** run in Expo Go.
- Manual QA on device: enable keyboard in Settings → Keyboards, enable Full
  Access, dictate into Messages/Notes/Safari.
- Verify: token sharing (sign in app → keyboard works without re-auth), 401
  after sign-out, 429 message, dark mode, memory (watch for jetsam) via
  Instruments.
- Since we can't run a simulator here, correctness is limited to: config-plugin
  prebuild succeeds, Swift compiles, and the cloud contract matches
  `/v2/transcribe`. Real validation needs a device build by the user.

## 9. Risks / open questions

- **Full Access friction**: the biggest UX hurdle; unavoidable. Mitigate with a
  clear in-app setup screen.
- **Memory**: even batch must be careful (release the recorder + audio buffer
  promptly). If we later want live partials, profile headroom first.
- **Apple review**: voice keyboards with network access get scrutiny; the
  privacy string + a clear purpose help. Not a code issue but a release one.
- **Token security**: keychain access group is the right call; confirm the
  `AppIdentifierPrefix` (team id) is available to the plugin at prebuild.
- **Android**: entirely separate (`InputMethodService`); out of scope for v1.

## 10. Phasing

1. Port `withKeyboardExtension.js`; get an **empty** keyboard building + showing
   in a dev client (no mic yet). Prove the plugin/prebuild/embed pipeline.
2. Add Full-Access gate + `AudioEngineCapture` + insert a hardcoded string on
   mic tap. Prove mic + text insertion.
3. Add `SharedStore` + `keyboard-bridge.ts` token/prefs sync. Prove the
   extension reads the app's session.
4. Add `CloudStreamSession` (`/v2/stream`) end-to-end with partials in the
   status strip → committed `final` inserted. Prove live dictation.
   Add `CloudTranscriber` batch fallback for socket failures.
5. (Optional) live in-field partials via delete/insert diffing.
6. Polish states/theme, error handling, in-app setup screen; profile memory.
7. (Later) Android keyboard (`InputMethodService`).
